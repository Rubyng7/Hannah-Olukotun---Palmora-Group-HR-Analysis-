### Result/Findings

- Rating Bias: Females had better performance rating than males but paid less.

- Both Male and Female Employees were paid almost equal bonus amount.

### Recommendations

- Implement gender-focused programs.

- Standardize recruitment for both gender

- Establish transparent salary bands and conduct regular pay audits.


### Limitations

- The dataset is static and reflects a snapshot in time; it does not track real-time changes.

- Some data fields were missing, which may reduce accuracy.
