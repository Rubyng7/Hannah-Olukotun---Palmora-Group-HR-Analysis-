### Result/Findings

- Gender Imbalance: A significant gender imbalance was identified in leadership roles, with males occupying over 70% of managerial positions.

- Pay Disparity: Male employees tend to have higher average salaries, especially in technical and management departments.

- Promotion Bias: Promotion trends favored male employees, particularly in the last three years.

- Attrition Patterns: Female employees showed a higher rate of exit within their first two years, suggesting potential onboarding or inclusion issues.

### Recommendations

- Implement gender-focused leadership development programs.

- Standardize promotion criteria and conduct blind reviews where possible.

- Establish transparent salary bands and conduct regular pay audits.

- Improve onboarding processes and conduct exit interviews to gather qualitative data from departing employees.

### Limitations

- The dataset is static and reflects a snapshot in time; it does not track real-time changes.

- Some data fields were missing, which may reduce accuracy.
